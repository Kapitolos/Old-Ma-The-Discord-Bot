Old Ma
This bot uses a combination of API's to give the weather in any given city in the world, inspirational quotes, dinner recipe's and more. But don't let her catch you swearing. 
The bot is hosted on repl.it so you'll need to create a Repl there and then input your API keys in the .env file for both a Discord bot and Weatherstack.
